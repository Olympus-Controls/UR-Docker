"""SafetyEnvelope — pre-execution validation, the ROSClaw "safety envelope".

Before any motion or script reaches the controller, the proposed action is
checked against a configurable envelope: joint range, joint speed/acceleration
caps, and required controller state. A check produces a :class:`SafetyVerdict`
listing every violation; the caller (Robot / the tool layer) refuses to
execute unless the verdict is clear.

The defaults are deliberately conservative and model-agnostic — they keep
URSim and a real UR10 from being commanded somewhere obviously unsafe. They
are *not* a substitute for the controller's own configured safety limits
(which are authoritative on real hardware); they are a first line of defense
that catches agent mistakes before they leave the host.

Tune them for your robot::

    env = SafetyEnvelope(max_joint_speed=1.0, max_joint_position=3.14)
    robot = Robot(safety=env)
