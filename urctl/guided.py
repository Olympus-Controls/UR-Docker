"""GuidedSession — build a PolyScope program step by step, confirming each step
on the robot's own pendant before it runs.

The workflow this implements: the operator issues a step from the console; the
robot raises a Yes/No popup on the PolyScope pendant describing *what it is
about to do*; on **Yes** the step executes live on the robot **and** is appended
to a growing program; on **No** (or no answer) it is skipped. Saving the session
yields a native node-tree ``.urp`` (see :mod:`urctl.urp_builder`) that replays
exactly the steps that were approved — openable and editable in PolyScope as
real program nodes, not an opaque script blob.

Design choices that matter:

* **Confirm, then act** — two Primary round-trips, not one. The confirmation
  (:meth:`Robot.confirm_on_pendant`) is separate from the motion so the motion
  still flows through :class:`urctl.safety.SafetyEnvelope`; inlining the action
  into the confirm script would bypass validation.
* **Record the achieved pose as a joint-space waypoint.** After a move runs we
  read where the robot actually ended up and store a joint-space ``Waypoint``,
  so the saved program reproduces the same physical position whether the step
  was issued in joint or Cartesian space. (Joint waypoints need no calibration
  to replay — see urp_builder.)
* **Only approved + executed steps are recorded.** A rejected step, a move the
  safety envelope refuses, or a move that doesn't confirm completion is logged
  in :attr:`steps` but never added to the program.
