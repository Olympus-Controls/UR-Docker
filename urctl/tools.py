"""Agent tool registry — the framework-neutral "openclaw friendly" surface.

This is what lets OpenClaw/ROSClaw (or any function-calling agent, or the MCP
server in :mod:`urctl.mcp_server`) drive the robot:

  * **Capability discovery** — :func:`get_tool_schemas` returns each capability
    as a name + description + JSON Schema, ready to drop into a model's
    tool-calling API ("standardized affordance injection").
  * **Pre-execution validation** — :func:`call_tool` checks arguments against
    the schema, then the handler runs them through the robot's safety envelope.
  * **Structured audit logging** — every call goes through :class:`Robot`, so
    it lands in the audit log with its arguments, result, and safety verdict.

The registry is plain data (no SDK), so the same tool definitions feed Claude's
API, an OpenAI-style ``tools=`` array, an MCP server, or a bespoke executive::
