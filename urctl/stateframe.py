"""The controller's binary state broadcast, decoded — the flange pose without a script.

Every UR controller streams a *robot state* message ~10 times a second to anyone
connected to the Primary (30001) or Secondary (30002) client port. It is sent
whatever the control mode: unlike a URScript ``textmsg`` query, which a real
e-Series in **Local** mode silently ignores (UR3e, PolyScope 5.25.1, 2026-09-27),
reading it needs no program, so it also never replaces a running one.

Three sub-packages of that message are enough to place the flange exactly:

* ``JOINT_DATA`` (type 1) — the six actual joint angles;
* ``KINEMATICS_INFO`` (type 5) — the robot's **calibrated** DH parameters (the
  deltas the factory calibration measured, not the datasheet's);
* ``CARTESIAN_INFO`` (type 4) — the TCP pose and the active TCP offset.

The flange comes from forward kinematics of the joints through the calibrated DH,
so it does not depend on which TCP the controller thinks is active (the active
offset has been wrong before: CLAUDE.md, "ur_flange_pose … wrong by tens of mm").
The Cartesian package then gives two things the kinematics cannot: the active TCP
offset — which a target for PolyScope's own move screen must be expressed in —
and a self-check: ``flange ∘ offset`` must land on the reported TCP pose.

Wire format (Client Interface, e-Series): a message is ``>iB`` (int32 length
including the header, uint8 type); robot state is type 16 and holds sub-packages,
each ``>iB`` (int32 length including the header, uint8 type) + payload, all
big-endian. Other message types (version, text, safety) are skipped by length.
