# Bill of materials: RealSense pick kit for UR e-Series (PolyScope 5)

**Prices checked 2026-09-28.** All prices are USD, per unit, qty 1, excluding tax, shipping and duty, unless the line says otherwise. EUR prices are converted at the ECB reference rate for 2026-09-28, **1 EUR = 1.1378 USD** ([ECB daily XML](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml)). "Not found" means I could not verify the number from a primary page or a distributor listing. It is not an estimate. Where a number came only from a search-engine result snippet (the page itself blocked the fetcher), the line says so.

**What the kit is.** A Raspberry-Pi-class industrial PC (arm64, minimal Debian, no GPU) runs the RGB-D cockpit and the pick server. It talks to the UR controller over Ethernet. One Intel/RealSense D435 hangs on the tool flange in the printed adapter (`hardware/d435-tool-bracket/`) and connects to the PC over USB 3. The reference cell is a UR3e with a Robotiq Hand-E.

## 2. Per-line detail

### K1: Industrial PC (primary): KUNBUS Revolution Pi RevPi Connect 5

- **Why this one.** It has two **USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 (5 Gbit/s)** ports. It takes **24 V DC (10.8 to 28.8 V)** and mounts on a DIN rail. It has two Gigabit Ethernet ports, so one can go to the robot and one to the plant, and 32 GB of eMMC, so no SD card is needed. It is rated -25 to +60 °C. The datasheet power budget is **22 W "incl. 2 x 900 mA USB load"**, so each USB port is budgeted for 900 mA, which covers a D435. It is built on the Raspberry Pi CM5 (BCM2712, 4x Cortex-A76 at 2.4 GHz), the same SoC as a Pi 5. Sources: [product page](https://revolutionpi.com/en/revpi-connect-5), [datasheet PDF](https://revolutionpi.com/fileadmin/downloads/datasheets/Datasheet_RevPi-Connect-5.pdf).
- **OS.** Flash Debian arm64 on it (decided 2026-09-28), not the shipped RevPi OS; `deploy/pi/` targets Debian.
- **Variant chosen.** 100416 = 8 GB RAM, 32 GB eMMC, RS485, no Wi-Fi. The 4 GB variant (100412) costs $81 less at Phytools. It has not been tested with the cockpit, so I did not pick it.
- **Manufacturer price.** The [KUNBUS price overview](https://revolutionpi.com/en/ordering/overview-products-and-prices) lists 100416 at EUR 579.00 base, plus a **EUR 70.00 RAM surcharge** and a **EUR 10.00 eMMC surcharge**. That is EUR 659.00 net (about $749.81), seen 2026-09-28. The [shop page](https://revolutionpi.com/shop/en/revpi-connect-5) shows EUR 581.00 net / EUR 691.39 gross for the entry model, which is EUR 536 + 35 + 10. Shop lead time shown: "5 - 8 working days".
- **Distributor price (used in the total).** [Phytools (US)](https://phytools.com/products/revpi-connect-5): KU-PR100416 = **$796.00**, in stock, 2026-09-28. For comparison, KU-PR100412 (4 GB) = $715.00. Other distributors: [Digi-Key product highlight](https://www.digikey.com/en/product-highlight/k/kunbus/revpi-connect-5), "variants range from $733.72 to $966.68" (2026-09-28). [Mouser listing](https://www.mouser.com/en/new/kunbus/kunbus-revpi-connect-5): price not found (the page timed out). [RS UK 0428438](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/industrial-computers/0428438): the fetcher got a 403. A search snippet showed GBP 646.61 for the 32 GB / 8 GB model, unverified.
- **Price history.**
  - Launched 2024-11-27 with "very limited availability at product launch" ([KUNBUS forum announcement](https://revolutionpi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4575)).
  - 2025-05-21: shop entry price EUR 499.00 net / EUR 593.81 gross ([Wayback snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20250521171540/https://revolutionpi.com/shop/en/revpi-connect-5)).
  - By 2026-06-09: base list EUR 536.00 for 100412, before the RAM surcharge ([Wayback snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20260609002435/https://revolutionpi.com/en/ordering/overview-products-and-prices)).
  - 2026-09-28: EUR 536 base + EUR 35 RAM + EUR 10 eMMC surcharge = EUR 581 for the entry model.
  - That is **+16 % on the entry model in 16 months**, driven by the separately itemised RAM surcharge (see §4, memory prices).

### K1-alt: Industrial PC (alternative): CompuLab IOT-GATE-RPI5

- **Why it's second.** It is built on the CM5, takes **12 to 24 V DC** with reverse-polarity protection, and supports DIN-rail or wall mounting. It is rated 0 to 60 °C (commercial) or -40 to 80 °C (industrial). But it has only **one USB 3.0 Type-A** port (plus one USB 2.0), which is enough for one D435 and leaves no spare. Its Ethernet is one GbE plus one **100 Mbit/s** port. Its eMMC is 16 to 64 GB, with an optional NVMe. Specs: [product page](https://www.compulab.com/products/iot-gateways/iot-gate-rpi5-industrial-raspberry-pi-iot-edge-gateway/), [LinuxGizmos, 2026-05-08](https://linuxgizmos.com/iot-gate-rpi5-is-a-fanless-raspberry-pi-cm5-gateway-with-rs485-and-can-fd/).

  - Online orders are capped at 5 units per customer.
  - The webshop lists only the LTE configurations. A no-modem SKU may exist through sales (not verified).
- **Distributor:** not found. CompuLab sells direct.
- **Price history:** not found. The product is new: announced around May 2026.

### Candidates screened and rejected (no line in the kit)

The D435 needs a real USB 3 link. At 848x480 @ 30 fps, depth (Z16, 2 B/px) plus colour (YUYV, 2 B/px) is about 2 x 195 = **about 390 Mbit/s of payload**, which is above what USB 2.0 carries in practice. The repo also measured that a D435 on USB 2 **offers no 848x480 colour mode at all** (`docs/realsense.md`, *USB 2 link*). A USB-2-only box cannot run the default pipeline.

| Candidate | Compute | USB to camera | Verdict | Price seen |
|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Raspberry Pi 5 8 GB + DIN case | BCM2712 | 2x USB 3.0, 5 Gbit/s simultaneous ([RPi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/)) | USB is fine. Rejected as the *kit* PC for three reasons. It needs 5 V / 5 A **USB-C PD**, so a 24 V cabinet needs a PD converter. On a 3 A supply the USB ports are limited to **600 mA total** (1.6 A only after a 5 A PD negotiation; [RPi docs](https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/blob/master/documentation/asciidoc/computers/raspberry-pi/power-supplies.adoc)). It boots from microSD. And at $175 the board alone has lost most of its price advantage. | SC1432: **$175** official (see history below); Digi-Key [SC1432](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/raspberry-pi/SC1432/21658257) $175.00 (search snippet; page 403) |

**Raspberry Pi 5 8 GB price history** (the same memory pressure drives CM5 and every CM5 box above):

| Date | Price | Change | Source |
|------|-------|--------|--------|

The $175 figure is the sum of Raspberry Pi's own announcements. The official product page did not render the 8 GB price for the fetcher (it did show 16 GB = $305). [How-To Geek (2026-08-06)](https://www.howtogeek.com/buying-raspberry-pi-2026-better-have-a-very-good-reason/) quotes $180 for 8 GB, which may be a reseller price.

### K2: DIN-rail PSU: Mean Well HDR-60-24

- 24 V, 2.5 A, 60 W, DIN rail. This gives headroom over the RevPi's 22 W maximum (the CompuLab takes 12 to 24 V too). Use a dedicated supply rather than borrowing the UR controller's I/O 24 V. If you do use the controller's supply, check its current budget in the UR manual first.
- Current: **Digi-Key [HDR-60-24](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/mean-well-usa-inc/HDR-60-24/7703804) $20.10.** The live page returns 403 to the fetcher; $20.10 is from the search listing on 2026-09-28 and matches the 2026-03-28 Wayback snapshot. Also [PowerSupplyMall](https://powersupplymall.com/products/mean-well-hdr-60-24-ultra-slim-step-shape-power-supply-60w-24v-din-rail) $24.34, in stock, 2026-09-28.
- History (Digi-Key via Wayback): **$25.30** on [2024-07-20](https://web.archive.org/web/20240720163629/https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/mean-well-usa-inc/HDR-60-24/7703804), then $20.10 on [2025-11-07](https://web.archive.org/web/20251107191418/https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/mean-well-usa-inc/HDR-60-24/7703804) and [2026-03-28](https://web.archive.org/web/20260328062616/https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/mean-well-usa-inc/HDR-60-24/7703804).
- It also needs a length of 35 mm DIN rail and a mains cord or terminal wiring, which the cabinet usually supplies. Not priced.

### K3: Depth camera: RealSense D435 (what the code and the bracket are built for)

- **Part number** 82635AWGDVKPRQ. **Manufacturer:** RealSense Inc. (spun out of Intel on 2025-07-11). The camera has a USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 port with screw-lock threads, a 1/4-20 and two M3 mounting points, and measures 90 x 25 x 25 mm ([product page](https://www.realsenseai.com/products/stereo-depth-camera-d435/)). Launched Q1 2018 ([Intel ARK](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/128255/intel-realsense-depth-camera-d435/specifications.html)).
- **Current price.** [RealSense store](https://store.realsenseai.com/buy-intel-realsense-depth-camera-d435.html): **$314.00**, "**Out of Stock**", lead time "**6-8 weeks**". A tariff surcharge applies to store orders from 2026-02-03. All seen 2026-09-28. The store page does not state the included cable's length.
- **Distributors.** [Digi-Key 82635AWGDVKPRQ](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/intel-realsense/82635AWGDVKPRQ/9926002): $333.75, no stock ("request stock notification"). This is from a search snippet; the page returns 403. [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Intel/82635AWGDVKPRQ?qs=wd5RIQLrsJh1kH/NlgqopQ%3D%3D): price not found (timed out).

[camelcamelcamel B07BLS5477](https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B07BLS5477) (the Amazon listing) blocks the fetcher, so the Amazon history is not found.

- **D435 vs D435i vs D405** ([store list prices, 2026-09-28](https://store.realsenseai.com/)):
  - **D435 ($314)** is what is used and what `bracket.py` locates by its tripod boss and M3 holes.
  - **D435i ($334)** is the same body with an IMU. The pick pipeline does not use the IMU, so the $20 buys nothing here. The bracket fits it, since the body and mounting points are the same.
  - **D436 ($354)** is listed as a D435i with a 1 MP global-shutter, wider-FOV RGB sensor ([librealsense #14858](https://github.com/realsenseai/librealsense/issues/14858)). Not evaluated.
  - **D405 ($272)** is short range (7 to 50 cm), has no IR projector, takes its RGB from the depth imagers, and measures 42 x 42 x 23 mm ([Robot Report](https://www.therobotreport.com/intel-adds-short-range-realsense-d405-depth-camera/)). It would remove the D435's under-0.2 m blind zone that forces the pick routine's 0.24 m close look. It needs a new bracket and has not been tested with this code. Optional line O5.

- **Why.** It is rated for **6,000,000 flex cycles**, has a TPE jacket, and has dual screw-lock USB-C plugs that match the D435's locking threads. Newnex rates the 3 m length at 5 Gbit/s, 5 V / 3 A, "max travel 2 m" (the length that may flex). Newnex's RealSense page says its A-to-C cables are made "for the Intel RealSense D435, D455". Sources: [high-flex family](https://newnex.com/usb-3-high-flex-cables.php), [A-to-C family](https://newnex.com/usb-type-c-cables-legacy.php), [RealSense page](https://newnex.com/realsense-3d-camera-connectivity.php), [drawing PDF](https://newnex.com/documents/U3HLA01C12-030.PDF).
- **Current price.** [NTC Distributing](https://www.ntcdistributing.com/usb-c/high-flex-usb-3-2-a-to-c-cable-with-dual-screw-locking-1m-2m-3-m-5-m/?sku=U3HLA01C12-030) (the distributor Newnex links to): **$188.00** (3 m). Same page: $148.00 for 1 m and $228.00 for 5 m. [Industrial Component](https://www.industrialcomponent.com/newnex/u3hla01c12/): $149.00 for 1 m; other lengths not shown. All 2026-09-28. Digi-Key and Mouser: not found.
- **History:** not found.
- **Length choice and a conflict with the repo's own note.** `docs/realsense.md` (Troubleshooting) says "≤ 2 m active-free cable, direct port". Newnex rates this 3 m passive cable for 5 Gbit/s, but that is the vendor's rating, not a test on this camera. **Verify at SuperSpeed on the first build** (`rs-enumerate-devices` / the doctor's USB line) before shipping 3 m. If it drops to USB 2, or the run is longer than 3 m, use the active 5 m cable (O2: [ULHLU11AC12-5M](https://newnex.com/high-flex-active-usb-3-cable.php), 4.7 m travel, minimum bend radius 12 x OD, about 75 mm; $399.00 at [Industrial Component](https://industrialcomponent.com/newnex/), 2026-09-28).
- **igus chainflex:** igus lists USB 3.0 chainflex cable (CFBUS.PUR.068) and harnessed readycables with USB-A / micro-B ends ([example](https://www.igus.com/product/readycable_buscable_USB9540201)). I found **no stocked igus USB-C screw-lock assembly**, so it is not a line here.

### K5: Ethernet: L-com TRD695SCR-BLK-10

- Shielded Cat6 (26 AWG stranded STP), RJ45 to RJ45, PVC jacket, 10 ft. It runs PC to controller inside or next to the cabinet, not along the arm, so a high-flex cable is not needed.
- Current: **[L-com](https://www.l-com.com/ethernet-shielded-cat-6-cable-rj45-rj45-pvc-jacket-black-100-ft) $42.19** at qty 1 (quantity breaks shown at $40.08, $37.97 and $36.28), 2026-09-28. Distributors carrying TRD695SCR-10 (grey): [Newark 84M7466](https://www.newark.com/l-com/trd695scr-10/patch-cord-category-6-shielded/dp/84M7466), [RS US 70126903](https://us.rs-online.com/product/l-com/trd695scr-10/70126903/). Prices not found (not fetched or blocked).
- If the cable has to ride a moving axis, use L-com's high-flex TRD695AHF series instead: 5 ft = $111.99 at qty 1 ([L-com](https://www.l-com.com/ethernet-double-shielded-cat6a-outdoor-industrial-high-flex-ethernet-cable-teal-rj45-rj45-50ft)).
- History: not found.

### K6: Cable management along the arm

- The Hand-E needs no extra cable: it runs through the tool connector. Only the USB cable has to follow the arm. It leaves the camera's end face and runs down with the tool-I/O side (bracket README §6 A1), so hook-and-loop straps at each link are enough for a UR3e.
- **VELCRO Brand ONE-WRAP, 1/2 in x 25 yd, black, part 189755:** **$50.00** for 1 roll at [iTapeStore](https://www.itapestore.com/velcro-brand-one-wrap-straps-one-half-inch-by-25-yard-rolls) ($39.90 each for 2 to 5 rolls), 2026-09-28. One roll covers many cells; the per-cell use is a metre or two. History: not found.
- **Upgrade (O1): igus triflex R "Universal Robots kit" for UR3(e)**, [TRE.918.067.LAE30](https://www.igus.eu/product/20680). The kit contains 1 mounting bracket with strain relief, the cobot clamps, and TRE.30 e-chain. It costs **EUR 241.15** (about $274.38) on igus.eu, "ready to ship within 24 hours", 2026-09-28. The size-40 version, TRE.918.067.LAE40, is EUR 247.65. The US price was not checked. History: not found.
- Spiral wrap (for example [Alpha Wire SW3](https://www.alphawire.com/products/accessories/fit-wire-management/spiral%20wrap/sw3)) is an alternative. Price not verified.

### K7: Bracket print material: PPA-CF

- The bracket README (§5) specifies PPA-CF (Bambu PPA-CF or Polymaker Fiberon PPA-CF). The e-Series print uses about 27 g of part and about 31 g of filament, printed on a hardened 0.4 mm nozzle at 300 to 320 °C in an enclosure. Alternatives: PA6-CF or PET-CF.
- **Bambu Lab PPA-CF, black, 0.75 kg with spool, SKU N06-K0-1.75-750-SPL:** **$149.99**, available, from the [Bambu US store product JSON](https://bambulab-us.myshopify.com/products/ppa-cf) (2026-09-28). That is $0.20/g, so 31 g = **$6.20** per bracket. Distributor: [MatterHackers](https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/bambu-lab-ppa-cf-filament/sk/MF7C2ZUL), $198.00 per 0.75 kg (search snippet). History: not found.
- **Polymaker Fiberon PPA-CF:** I found no such product in Polymaker's shop on 2026-09-28. The nearest Fiberon grade is [Fiberon PA6-CF20](https://shop.polymaker.com/products/fiberon-pa6-cf20) (FG03001): $39.99 per 0.5 kg, in stock, with 3 kg for $159.99. The README's "Polymaker Fiberon PPA-CF" should be checked.
- **Heat-set inserts:** **none.** The bracket README's hardware list (§4) has no inserts. The camera screws go into the D435's own 1/4-20 and M3 threads, and the tool bolts pass straight through the plate into the flange.
- The UR20/UR30 print uses about 45 g of filament (about $9). It is not part of the UR3e kit.

### K8 to K12: Fasteners (bracket README §4)

- **K8. 1/4-20 UNC x 1/2 in flat head socket cap, 82 deg, 18-8 stainless, qty 1:** [U-Turn Fasteners SCFH025C0050SS](https://www.uturnfasteners.com/1-4-20-x-1-2-flat-head-socket-cap-screw-18-8-stainless-steel/), **$0.08**, 255 in stock, 2026-09-28. The README says to measure the D435's thread depth first (A4); a 7/16 in screw is the fallback. Torque 1.5 N·m. History: not found.
- **K9. M3 x 8 flat head, 90 deg, DIN 965, A2, qty 2:** [Monster Bolts](https://monsterbolts.com/products/mach-phil-flat-a2-m3), 10-pack "SA2 M03 x 008.0010", **$0.89**, in stock, 2026-09-28. The camera allows **at most 3 mm engagement and 0.4 N·m**. History: not found.
- **K10. Tool bolts, qty 4.** The README rule is "the tool's own bolts, 8 mm longer". The Hand-E e-Series coupling (GRP-ES-CPL-062) mounts with M6 x 10 low-head socket cap screws: the manual lists M6-1.0 low-head clearance on the ISO 50-4-M6 coupling and M6 x 10 screws for coupling mounting ([Hand-E e-Series manual PDF](https://assets.robotiq.com/website-assets/support_documents/document/Hand-E_Instruction_Manual_e-Series_PDF_20190122.pdf), §3.4.2 and §6). Two things need checking before the first fit:
  - "+8 mm" gives M6 x 18, but the adapter plate is only **6 mm** thick, so M6 x 18 adds 2 mm of engagement in the flange. The flange allows **≤ 8 mm** of engagement (README §2).
  - Monster Bolts stocks DIN 7984 A2 M6 in 12, 16 and 20 mm, not 18.
  - This BOM lists **M6 x 16** (10 + 6 = the Hand-E's original engagement). [Monster Bolts](https://monsterbolts.com/products/socket-low-hd-a2-m6) 10-pack "SA2 M06 x 016.0010" costs **$3.05** (the 20 mm 10-pack is $3.55), 2026-09-28.
  - **Measure the Hand-E coupling's actual screw engagement before ordering.** The M6 x 10 length is from the dual-gripper mounting step in Robotiq's manual; I did not find it stated for the single-gripper wrist mount. History: not found.
- **K11. Dowel pin, dia. 6 m6 x 20, qty 1.** It passes through the adapter's pin slot into the flange and stands proud for the tool's pin hole. Robotiq's manual says robot-side hardware is not supplied: "Unless specified, screws, dowel pins and other hardware are included only for the Gripper side, never for the robot side." Source for the ISO 8734 m6 specification: [Fuller Fasteners](https://fullerfasteners.com/products/iso-8734-hardened-dowel-pins-m6/). **Price: not found.** McMaster-Carr and MISUMI (both carry m6-tolerance 6 x 20 pins: [McMaster](https://www.mcmaster.com/products/dowel-pins/thread-size~m6-2/), [MISUMI](https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/press/P0300000000/P0302000000/P0302010000/P0302010100/?CategorySpec=00000031438::c)) blocked the fetcher.
- **K12. Medium-strength threadlocker** on the flat heads (bracket README §4). Robotiq also calls for it on the gripper screws. **Price: not found.**

### C1: Universal Robots UR3e (customer-supplied, reference)

- UR does not publish list prices. The only priced listing I could verify is [Devonics](https://www.devonics.com/product-page/universal-robots-ur3e): "$30,852.00 USD per unit" base, shown as $33,011.00 with options, 2026-09-28. Aggregators put the UR3e at $23,000 to $38,000 for 2026 ([cobotcost.com](https://cobotcost.com/vendor/ur3e/), [Standard Bots](https://standardbots.com/blog/universal-robot-price)). Those are ranges, not quotes.
- History: not found. The e-Series launched in 2018.

### C2: Robotiq Hand-E, e-Series kit (customer-supplied, reference)

- **HND-ES-UR-KIT** contains the gripper unit HND-GRP-001, fingertip starting kit HND-TIP-START-KIT, coupling GRP-ES-CPL-062, screw kit, and a URCap USB stick ([Robotiq manual](https://assets.robotiq.com/website-assets/support_documents/document/Hand-E_Instruction_Manual_e-Series_PDF_20190122.pdf)).
- Current: **[Automation Distribution](https://automationdistribution.com/robotiq-hnd-es-ur-kit-ur-kit-hand-e-for-e-series/) $8,416.41**, stock not shown, 2026-09-28. Other listings: [RS US 72506890](https://us.rs-online.com/product/robotiq/hnd-es-ur-kit/72506890/) (403) and [Logic Control](https://www.logic-control.com/robotiq-hnd-es-ur-kit), prices not found.

## 3. Subtotals

| Group | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| **Kit per cell, primary PC (RevPi Connect 5, 100416)** | **$1,420.51** + K11, K12 (not found) |
| Kit per cell, alternative PC (CompuLab IOT-GATE-RPI5 8 GB + DIN clip) | $1,112.01 + K11, K12 |
| Kit per cell, primary, bought from KUNBUS direct instead of Phytools (EUR 659 = $749.81) | $1,374.32 + K11, K12 + import duty/shipping |
| Customer-supplied (UR3e + Hand-E kit) | $39,268.41 |
| Optional upgrades (O1 igus dress pack + O2 active 5 m cable, if both) | about $673.38 |

Recurring consumables are counted per cell: the ONE-WRAP roll ($50.00) and the PPA-CF spool ($149.99, about 24 brackets per spool) are bought once and shared across builds. Costing only what one cell uses, the primary kit is about **$1,375** (hook-and-loop about $4, filament $6.20).

## 4. Lead times and availability risks

1. **RealSense D435: out of stock at the source, and a change of owner.**
   - The RealSense store shows the D435 as "Out of Stock", lead time **6 to 8 weeks**, with a **tariff surcharge on store orders since 2026-02-03** (2026-09-28). Digi-Key shows no stock (search snippet).
   - RealSense spun out of Intel on **2025-07-11** with a $50 M Series A ([RealSense press release](https://www.realsenseai.com/news-insights/news/realsense-completes-spin-out-from-intel-raises-50-million-to-accelerate-ai-powered-vision-for-robotics-and-biometrics/)).
   - On **2026-09-22** Cognex agreed to buy RealSense for about **$500 M in cash**, **expected to close in Q4 2026** ([Cognex 8-K exhibit 99.1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/851205/000085120526000071/exhibit991-pressrelease.htm)). The release says nothing about D400 continuity or pricing.
   - Plan on **8+ weeks for the camera**, buy cameras ahead of kit builds, and re-check the list price after the deal closes.
   - The D435's list price has already gone up 75 % since launch ($179 to $314, all of it between mid-2021 and late 2022).
2. **Memory-driven price rises on everything CM5 / Pi 5.**
   - Raspberry Pi raised prices four times between 2025-10-01 and 2026-04-01. The Pi 5 8 GB went from $80 to $175, and the CM5 8 GB rose by +$10 in Oct 2025, +$30 in Feb 2026 (the per-density table) and +$50 in Apr 2026.
   - KUNBUS now itemises a **RAM surcharge (EUR 35 for 4 GB, EUR 70 for 8 GB)** and an eMMC surcharge (EUR 10) on top of the RevPi list price. Expect the PC line to move again.
   - Raspberry Pi says it will reverse the rises "once memory prices return to their long-term downward trajectory" ([RPi, 2026-02-02](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/more-memory-driven-price-rises/)). No date given.
3. **RevPi Connect 5:** shipped with "very limited availability" at launch (Nov 2024). It is now "5 - 8 working days" from KUNBUS and in stock at Phytools (2026-09-28).
4. **CompuLab IOT-GATE-RPI5:** in stock with 2-day shipping, but **webshop orders are capped at 5 units per customer**. The listed SKUs carry an unneeded LTE modem.
5. **USB cable:** a single-source Newnex part (NTC Distributing / Industrial Component). No lead time is shown.
6. **Hand-E / UR3e:** priced through integrators; no public list price or lead time.
