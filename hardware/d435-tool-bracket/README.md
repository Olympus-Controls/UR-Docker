# D435 tool-flange adapter — specification / datasheet

**Part:** `d435_tool_bracket` · **Rev:** B.2 (2026-09-04: 6 mm plate, 56-wide wall; e-Series print is ISO-50-only on a Ø63 disc — 29.7 cm³, −56 % vs Rev B) · **Status:** designed, exported, *not yet printed or test-fitted*
**Files:** `bracket.py` (parametric source, CadQuery) · **two prints**, `out/d435_tool_bracket_eseries.{stl,step}` and `out/d435_tool_bracket_ur20.{stl,step}` · `out/d435_tool_bracket_assembly_{eseries,ur20}.step` (flange + adapter + camera envelope + hardware) · `out/d435_body_in_flange_frame.stl` (Intel's D435 body, placed) · `renders/*.png`

A one-piece **sandwich adapter plate** for an Intel RealSense D435 on a Universal Robots tool flange, built as **two prints from one parametric file**: an ISO 9409-1-50-4-M6 print for the UR3e/5e/10e/16e (Ø63 disc, ISO-50 only) and an ISO 9409-1-80-6-M8 print for the UR20/UR30 (Ø96 disc, which also keeps the ISO-50 holes). The pattern holes are plain through holes, so the tool's own bolts pass through the plate into the robot. The camera **hangs beside the wrist, back along −Z, on the tool-I/O connector side** (so both cables leave together), with its front plate flush with the adapter's tool face and its optical axis along flange +Z: nothing of the camera or the adapter rises into the tool's volume. The 1/4-20 and the two M3 enter through the hanging wall from the wrist side, **countersunk flush** — fit the camera to the adapter first, then bolt the adapter to the robot.

**Two variants, one design.** The base parameters describe a Ø96 plate with both patterns and a wall that clears a Ø100 housing; each print applies a few overrides on top (`variant_params`, `VARIANTS` in `bracket.py`) — the geometry code is shared:

| Variant | Plate / patterns | Wall position | Camera clocking | Bottom spigot | Top recess |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `eseries` (UR3e/5e/10e/16e) | **Ø63 × 6, ISO-50 only** (`ESERIES_PLATE_OD`, `ESERIES_PATTERNS`) | r = 48 … 54, 3 mm off the Ø90 wrist (`ESERIES_WRIST_R`); camera at r = 54 … 79 | `ARM_ANGLE_DEG = 90` — on the tool-I/O side | Ø31.3 × 4 into the Ø31.5 H7 recess | Ø31.7 × 4 for an ISO-50 tool's spigot |
| `ur20` (UR20/UR30) | Ø96 × 6, ISO-80 + ISO-50 | r = 53 … 59, 3 mm off the Ø100 housing; camera at r = 59 … 84 | `UR20_ARM_ANGLE_DEG = 45` — 45° off the M8 socket (§6.10) | **+ Ø49.8 × 3 ring into the Ø50 H7 pilot** (`UR20_SPIGOT_OD`) | **Ø50.2 × 4** for an ISO-80 tool's spigot (`UR20_TOP_RECESS_D`) |

Each variant is fully located on its own robot (pilot + pin + bolts) and re-presents that robot's ISO interface to the tool. The e-Series print dropped the ISO-80 pattern in Rev B.2 (Nick: optimise the e-Series) — that is what lets it shrink to the flange face and pull the camera 5 mm in. The UR20 print keeps the ISO-50 holes; on a Ø96 disc they cost nothing.

Rev A (2026-09-02) was a Ø63 plate with a 90° arm and the camera standing *above* the plate on +X; it read as looking sideways and would have fouled any tool. Everything below replaces it.

The camera in the renders is Intel's own D435 body mesh (`vendor/`, see the NOTICE there), not a box.

## 1. Requirements (what this part must do)

| ID | Requirement | How it is met | Verified |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | Mount on a UR e-Series ISO 9409-1-50-4-M6 flange **or** (second print) a UR20/UR30 ISO 9409-1-80-6-M8 flange | `eseries`: Ø63 × 6 plate, 4× Ø6.6 on Ø50 PCD (45°/135°/225°/315°), pin slot at 12 o'clock, Ø31.3 spigot into the Ø31.5 H7 recess. `ur20`: Ø96 × 6, + 6× Ø9 on Ø80 PCD (0°/60°/…/300°), Ø8 pin slot, Ø49.8 spigot into the Ø50 H7 pilot | dims from the UR10e and UR20 manuals (§2) |
| R2 | Camera optical axis along flange +Z, looking away from the flange | camera bottom on a wall parallel to Z; Intel's mesh placed by its tripod boss confirms the lens plate faces +Z | render `top_xy.png`, `derived()` |
| R3 | Camera does not interfere with tooling | camera front plate **flush with the tool face** (z = 6); body and wall extend only to −Z, beside the wrist (r ≥ 53) | `side_xz.png` |
| R4 | Camera can be fitted before the adapter goes on the robot | 1/4-20 + 2× M3 from the wrist-side face, countersunk flush; 3 mm clearance to the wrist (Ø90 e-Series / Ø100 UR20) | `wrist_side.png` |
| R5 | Tool still mounts normally | all pattern holes are through holes for the tool's own bolts (+8 mm); top recess Ø31.7 × 5 re-presents the Ø31.5 pilot to an ISO-50 tool; pin slots pass the pin through to the tool | — |
| R6 | Cable exit unobstructed | USB-C is on the camera's **back face** at its left end (Intel mesh); it exits along −Z beside the wrist, where nothing is | §6 A1 |
| R7 | Printable in PPA-CF; simple enough for machining | Z-extrusions + one set of radial holes; no supports in the recommended orientation | §5 |
| R9 | Camera on the tool-I/O side, clear of the M8 plug | `ARM_ANGLE_DEG = 90` puts the wall at 12 o'clock. e-Series socket is 35.65 behind the face and the wall ends 19.05 behind it: **10.6 mm axial clearance** to a Ø12 plug. The UR20's socket is only 17.6 behind its face, so the UR20 part is clocked 45° off (`UR20_ARM_ANGLE_DEG`, 6.6° angular clearance) | `derived()["tool_connector"]`, `side_xz.png` |
| R8 | Others can iterate | every number is a named parameter in `bracket.py`; STL/STEP/renders regenerate from one command | this file |

## 3. Geometry (all mm, from `bracket.py` PARAMS → `derived()`)

Frame: origin = centre of the flange face, +Z = away from the flange (tool direction, optical axis), +Y = towards the pin holes and the tool-I/O socket. **The camera side is on +Y too** (`ARM_ANGLE_DEG = 90`; the geometry is authored on +X and only the tab, wall and camera fasteners rotate — the plate features stay with the robot). The wall sits outside the patterns, so any angle builds; only the M8 plug limits it (R9). **Positions below are the `eseries` print**; the `ur20` print's plate is Ø96 with the ISO-80 rows added and everything on the camera side 5 mm further out (wall 53 … 59, camera 59 … 84) at 45°.

**Nominal camera pose (hand-eye seed).** Camera axes in flange axes: `x_cam = −X`, `y_cam = −Y` (image-down points at the mounting wall), `z_cam = +Z`; camera-left is +X. Depth origin (left imager) = **(17.5, 66.5, 1.7) mm** in the flange frame for the `eseries` print. (`ur20` print, 45° and 5 mm further out: (62.9, 38.2, 1.7) — `build_info.json` → `export.variants.ur20.derived`.) These are `perception.handeye.BRACKET_SEEDS` (`PERCEPTION_BRACKET=eseries|ur20` picks one; `tests/test_handeye.py` holds them to `build_info.json`); calibrate to finish — a printed part will not hold ±1°.

## 4. Hardware (BOM)

| Qty | Item | Spec / note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 or 6 | **The tool's own bolts, 8 mm longer** (M6 on e-Series, M8 on UR20/UR30) | the adapter has no bolts of its own; engagement limits are the flange's (≤ 8 mm e-Series, ≤ 17.25 mm UR20) |
| 1 | Dowel pin Ø6 m6 × 20 (e-Series) or Ø8 m6 × 24 (UR20) | through the slot, proud for the tool's pin hole |
| 1 | **1/4-20 UNC × 1/2" flat head, 82°** (stainless) | through the 6 mm wall → ~6.7 mm into the camera; the mesh shows a ≈ 8 mm bore, but **measure the thread depth with a pin before the first fit** (§6 A4). Torque 1.5 N·m |
| 2 | **M3 × 8 flat head, 90°** (DIN 965) | 2 mm into the camera (**max 3 mm**, 0.4 Nm) |
| — | Thread-locker (medium) on the flat heads | plastic seats relax; re-torque after 24 h |

Countersunk heads are the whole point: the wrist-side face of the wall is 3 mm from a UR20's Ø100 housing (8 mm from an e-Series wrist), so nothing may stand proud there. **Sequence: camera → adapter → robot → tool.**

## 5. Material, printing, torque

- **Material:** PPA-CF (Bambu PPA-CF / Polymaker Fiberon PPA-CF). Dry the spool (≥ 8 h at 80–100 °C). Hardened 0.4 nozzle, ~300–320 °C, bed 80–100 °C, enclosure. Alternative: PA6-CF or PET-CF.
- **Orientation: tool face on the bed** (the chamfered face down, wall pointing up). Everything is then a vertical extrusion: the wall rises 25 mm from the bed, the spigot ring points up, the top recess is a 4 mm pocket in the first layers, and the three countersunk holes print as horizontal cones in the wall — no supports. Layer lines run parallel to the plate; the wall's bending load (72 g on a 25 mm lever ≈ 0.02 N·m) is negligible on a 56 × 6 section.
- **Walls/infill:** 4 perimeters, 30 % gyroid, 5 top/bottom layers, 0.2 mm layers. A 6 mm plate is then 2 mm skin + 2 mm skin + 2 mm of infill, i.e. ~75 % of solid, and the 6 mm wall is all perimeters. Expect ≈ 27 g of part and ≈ 31 g of filament for the e-Series print (**≈ $6–8** at $0.20–0.26/g for Bambu PPA-CF), ≈ 40 g / 45 g / $9–12 for the UR20 print. Don't go below 4 walls: the countersinks need the perimeters.
- **Fit tuning:** `SPIGOT_OD` (31.3) should slip into the Ø31.5 H7 recess by hand; `HOLE_PRINT_ALLOWANCE` adds to every hole if your printer undersizes (typical 0.1–0.2 with CF filaments). Countersinks are cut to the nominal head; print them 0.2 over (`TRIPOD_CSK_D`, `M3_CSK_D`) if the heads stand proud.
- **Torque (plastic joint):** tool bolts as the tool maker specifies (they clamp through the plate onto the flange — the plate is in compression only, 6 mm PPA-CF is fine). 1/4-20: 1.5 N·m. M3: 0.4 N·m (Intel).
- **Machining:** the same file mills from 6 mm aluminium plate + a bolted-on 6 mm wall, or 3-axis from a 90 × 65 × 25 (e-Series) / 110 × 110 × 25 (UR20) block (top/bottom setups + one side op for the countersinks).

## 6. Design considerations and assumptions

1. **A1 — USB-C.** Now known from Intel's mesh: back face, camera-left end (X ≈ +36 … +45, Y ≈ 66.5 on the e-Series print), exiting along −Z. A straight plug needs ~25 mm below the camera's back face (z < −19); that space is empty (wrist at r ≤ 45, camera at r ≥ 54), and the tool-I/O cable leaves 35 mm further back on the same side, so both run down the arm together. A right-angle plug is tidier. **Checked on Nick's unit (2026-09-12): the connector is on an *end* face (left/right), not the back** — Intel's 2018 mesh differs there. Both ends are free (X = ±45 is open beyond the camera envelope, 5 mm above the plate), so the cable leaves sideways along ±X and needs no change to the print; route it down the arm with the tool-I/O cable.
2. **A2 — spigot depth.** UR's drawing does not state the e-Series recess depth; ISO 9409-1 recesses are ≥ 6 mm on the 50 flange. The 4 mm spigot leaves margin. If the plate rocks, the spigot is bottoming: shorten `SPIGOT_H`.
3. **A3 — UR20 pilot depth.** The `ur20` print's Ø49.8 ring is 3 mm tall; the UR20 drawing shows the Ø50 H7 bore as a through bore, so it cannot bottom. Its fit (`UR20_SPIGOT_OD`) is the same 0.2 print allowance as the e-Series spigot — tune after the first print. The Ø31.3 spigot is still there inside it and touches nothing on a UR20.
4. **A4 — 1/4-20 thread depth.** Intel's D435 drawing gives no max insertion for the 1/4-20 (the D455 says 9 mm); the mesh bore is ≈ 8 mm deep. The 1/2" flat head gives ~6.7 mm — measure before the first fit; a 7/16" screw or a 0.5 mm shim under the head is the fallback.
5. **Field of view.** The front plate is coplanar with the adapter's tool face, so the adapter is entirely behind the lens plane. What *will* be in view is the tool: the camera looks along +Z from y ≈ 66 mm, x ≈ 17.5 mm, so a tool body wider than ~110 mm across the camera side shadows the near field. Normal eye-in-hand; mask in perception if needed.
6. **Why two prints, not one dual plate.** Rev B was one Ø100 plate with both patterns. The ISO-80 holes force Ø95+, and a Ø50 pilot ring can't coexist with a Ø63 face — so the dual part was heavier than either robot needs *and* located worse on both. Two prints from one file cost nothing extra and let each be fully located; the e-Series one is 56 % lighter than the dual part.
7. **Why the pin slots are radial.** Each flange's pilot and pin hole both define position; a round pin hole in the tool over-constrains. UR says slot it radially (both manuals).
8. **Why hang the camera, not stand it.** Rev A stood the camera 38 mm above the plate — inside the tool's volume and looking like it pointed sideways. Hanging it beside the wrist costs nothing in reach (the wrist is there anyway), keeps the lens plane at the tool face, and makes the fasteners a pre-assembly step.
9. **Stiffness.** L-section 56 × 6 tab + 56 × 6 × 25 wall, filleted; far beyond what 72 g needs. No gussets — anything on the wrist side of the wall is in the clearance zone.
10. **Tool-I/O side, and why the UR20 part is clocked.** The wall spans ±30° about its centre (±28 mm at r = 48 … 53) and reaches 19 mm behind the face. On an e-Series the M8 socket is 35.65 behind the face, so a straight plug (Ø12) passes 10.6 mm below the wall. On a UR20/UR30 the socket is 17.6 behind the face — the plug would be inside the wall — so `UR20_ARM_ANGLE_DEG = 45` clocks that print 45° off the connector (6.6° clear). It is the same file; only the tab/wall rotate.
11. **Safety.** Adapter + camera ≈ 100 g (e-Series print) with the CoG ~40 mm off the flange axis and ~0 mm along Z; add it to the UR payload/CoG (`Installation → Payload`) or the torque model drifts.

## 7. Verification checklist (fill in after the first print)

- [ ] `eseries`: spigot seats in the Ø31.5 recess without rocking; note the measured spigot OD and recess depth
- [ ] `ur20`: Ø49.8 ring enters the Ø50 H7 bore by hand; ISO-80 tool spigot enters the Ø50.2 top recess
- [ ] Ø6 pin passes the inner slot; Ø8 pin passes the outer slot; plate cannot rotate
- [ ] Tool bolts (+8 mm) enter freely through the plate; torque per the tool maker
- [ ] 1/4-20 engages ≤ the measured thread depth; M3 ≤ 3 mm (depth gauge first)
- [ ] Flat heads flush or below the wrist-side face; wall clears the wrist through a full wrist-3 rotation
- [ ] USB-C plug seats with the cable running along −Z; no contact (A1)
- [ ] `perception rs-info` sees the camera; `perception gui` shows the tool where §6.5 predicts
- [ ] Hand-eye calibration result vs. the nominal (17.5, 66.5, 1.7) mm / axis map in §3
- [ ] Tool-I/O plug seats with the wall in place (e-Series: 10.6 mm predicted clearance)
- [ ] Payload updated on the pendant

Outputs land in `out/` (STL + STEP per variant, an assembly STEP per variant, the placed camera body STL, `build_info.json` with the per-variant overrides, derived numbers and the tool-connector clearance check) and `renders/`. Any `UR20_*` / `ESERIES_*` parameter can be overridden on the command line like the rest (tuples as JSON, e.g. `ESERIES_PATTERNS='["iso50","iso80"]'` brings the dual plate back). Sources for every external number are cited in `bracket.py`'s docstring and `vendor/NOTICE.md`.
